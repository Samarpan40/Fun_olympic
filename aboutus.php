				Fun Olympic is the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions.The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more  than  200  teams, representing sovereign states  and territories,  participating.The Fun Olympic  Games  are an  international  sports festival, held every four years. The ultimate goals are to cultivate human beings, through sports, and contribute to world peace. Summer Games and Winter Games are held separately.<br>
			The Olympic Games were technically restricted to freeborn Greeks. Many Greek competitors came from the Greek colonies on the Italian peninsula and in   Asia Minor and Africa. Most of the participants were professionals who trained full-time for  the events. These athletes  earned  substantial   prizes  for winning at many other preliminary festivals,   and, although the only prize at Olympia was a wreath or garland, an Olympic champion also received widespread adulation and often lavish benefits from his home city.</p>
